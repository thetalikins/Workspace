 What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

 When the screen is shrunk more than 550px, which is the max width for a mobile phone or tablet-sized reader, is that all alignments are brought into a single column for maximum UX. I believe this is a set rule in CSS designed with responsiveness (and mobile-first) in mind.
