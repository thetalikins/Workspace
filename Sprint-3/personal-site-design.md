My site's primary purpose is to share the learning -- both technical and cultural -- that I'm exploring during my time at EDA. The target audience of this site includes both my fellow cohort students as well as potential employers who'd like to see a bit of my previous work. I would like visitors to interact with my site in a way that is both visually, organizationally, and emotionally appealing. All of these attributes should be underscored by accessibility (both in technical responsiveness, applications to adapative technologies, and inclusive in language). I would like visitors to experience my enthusiasm to learn, adapt, participate, and create. I aspire to use this site to cultivate access and engagement with meaningful content and conversations. To accomplish this, I will build a site that is well organized and defined, that is simple and elegant, yet fulfilling and inspired!! :)
